        whip — a fast coding-agent harness in Go
```

An LLM tool-use loop (bash / read / write / edit / task), an interactive
bubbletea session, and provider-routable models. One binary, no runtime,
config you can read.

## Why whip

- **Agent harnesses should be FAST** — literally as fast as possible. whip is
  built in Go around that constraint: parallel tool calls, streaming
  everything, nothing between you and the model but a loop.
- **Defaults across other harnesses suck.** They all have awesome patterns,
  but none of them bring them all together. whip cherry-picks the best ideas
  from pi, opencode, codex, and exo into one opinionated harness
  (see [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md) — every feature cites its source).
- **Go is great for networking-heavy applications**, and harnesses do a whole
  lot of networking. whip leans on channels where the TypeScript reference
  designs hand-roll promises — per-path file locks and background subagents
  collapse into primitives the compiler checks
  ([docs/concurrency.md](docs/concurrency.md)).
- **whip is focused on a future where open-source models are the preferred
  models.** Keeping up with those models is hard — whip brings you an
  opinion on what model you should be using: live discovery from every
  provider's catalog, new models surfaced in the picker, a fast default that
  tracks the frontier.

## Install

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/context-labs/whip/main/install.sh | sh
```

Checksum-verified prebuilt binaries (Linux/macOS, x64/arm64). Or from source
(Go ≥ 1.27):

```sh
go install github.com/context-labs/whip/cmd/whip@latest
```

Then `whip` and you're in. Defaults to inference.net models — any
OpenAI-compatible endpoint works as a provider.

## Codex subscription

Whip can use an existing ChatGPT/Codex subscription instead of an API key.
First sign in with `pi /login openai-codex` or `codex login`, then configure
the provider explicitly:

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "codex": {
      "name": "Codex",
      "baseUrl": "https://chatgpt.com/backend-api",
      "api": "openai-codex-responses",
      "auth": "codex"
    }
  },
  "models": {
    "gpt-5.4": {
      "providers": ["codex"],
      "context": 272000,
      "maxOut": 128000
    }
  }
}
```

Whip prefers Pi's local auth file and falls back to Codex CLI auth. Expiring
tokens refresh locally and are never printed or added to conversations. This
provider has no compatible model catalog, so set `context` and `maxOut`
explicitly. OAuth credentials are only sent to
`https://chatgpt.com/backend-api`.

## First things to try

```
/context-doctor     audit what a fresh session injects, in tokens
/goal <text>        work until done
/model              pick a model — type to filter (new) entries come from the
                    provider catalog, no config needed
```

Drop a `.mcp.json` in your repo and MCP servers just appear (`/mcp` to see
them). ctrl+c once interrupts; twice quits.

## Themes

Set `"theme": "dark"`, `"light"`, or a custom theme name in
`~/.whip/config.json`. Custom JSONC themes live in
`~/.whip/themes/<name>.json` and appear in `/theme`. To preview a directory of
themes while editing, run `go run ./cmd/themes --dir ./cmd/themes/examples`.
